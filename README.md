# Restaurant project

The aim of this project is to create a webpage for a fictive restaurant franchise.

This project was developed in September 2019 in 4 days by myself as part of the <a href="https://www.becode.org/">BeCode.org</a> promotion Johnson 4.14. If after 4 days the website has not reached completion of all the objectives, it can eventually be finished later.

As part of my learning journey, and to show everyone starts somewhere, a screenshot of the website after 4 days will be placed in this Readme later.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Website created using CSS framework</li>
    <li>Website contains 5 pages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Main: contains jumbotron and 2 panels</li>
            <li>Menu: containts a list with badges</li>

            <li>Restaurants page: contains a page with different addresses, a pam and schedules for each place</li>
            <li>Contact: contains a contact form</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Contain royalty-free pictures</li>
    <li>Personal objective: as the franchise will be Japanese, the hiragana / katakana symbols should be readable by the browser</li>
</ul>
