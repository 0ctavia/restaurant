# Restaurant project

The aim of this project is to create a webpage for a fictive restaurant franchise, which can be found <a href="https://0ctavia.github.io/restaurant/">here</a>.

This project was developed in September 2019 in 4 days by myself as part of the <a href="https://www.becode.org/">BeCode.org</a> promotion Johnson 4.14, on the third week of our classes. If after 4 days the website has not reached completion of all the objectives, it can eventually be finished later.

As part of my learning journey, and to show everyone starts somewhere, a screenshot of the website after 4 days will be placed in this Readme later.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
